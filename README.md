# Intow
Intow is a small console application that is able to send keys to specified destination windows. It uses a special technique that allows it to send input to application windows that normally would block virtual inputs. Intow stands for "input to window".

# Features
- Sending arbitrary many series of keys, so called inputs, in a loop
- Sending to multiple windows at the same time

# Console interface
Intow is fully controlled by interacting with the console. The commands (capitalization is irrelevant):
